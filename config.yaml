# Configuration file for Speech-to-Text Dictation Tool
# This file allows you to customize the behavior of the dictation tool

# Hotkey Configuration
hotkeys:
  # Primary push-to-talk hotkey (hold to record, release to transcribe)
  # Available keys: ctrl, cmd (Windows key), alt, shift, space, and any letter key
  # Format: List of keys that must be pressed together
  push_to_talk:
    - ctrl
    - cmd  # Windows key on Windows/Linux, Command key on Mac

  # Toggle continuous dictation mode (press once to start, press again to stop)
  # Changed from Ctrl+Shift+D to avoid terminal conflicts
  toggle_continuous:
    - ctrl
    - alt
    - c

# Audio Settings
audio:
  # Sample rate (Hz) - Whisper requires 16000
  sample_rate: 16000

  # Number of channels (1 = mono, 2 = stereo)
  channels: 1

  # Audio chunk size (lower = less latency, higher = more stable)

# Whisper Model Configuration
model:

  # Larger models are more accurate but slower and use more resources
  # Using base.en for good quality/speed balance on CPU
  name: base.en

  # Device: cuda (GPU) or cpu
  # Set to "auto" to automatically detect and use GPU if available
  # Using CPU mode by default to avoid CUDA version conflicts

  # int8 uses less VRAM but may be slightly less accurate
  compute_type: int8

  # Beam size for decoding (higher = more accurate but slower)
  beam_size: 5

  # Language (set to null for auto-detection)
  language: en

# Text Processing

  # Custom vocabulary replacements
  # Replace transcribed words/phrases with custom text
  custom_vocabulary:
    # Example: "dictation tool" will be replaced with "DictationTool"
    # "dictation tool": "DictationTool"
    # "my email": "user@example.com"

  # Command words that trigger special actions
  # Format: "command word": "action"
  # Available actions: clear_line, undo_last
  command_words:
    "delete that": "undo_last"
    "scratch that": "undo_last"
    "clear line": "clear_line"

# Continuous Dictation Mode with Auto Silence Detection
continuous_mode:
  # Enable continuous dictation mode by default
  enabled: false

  # Silence detection threshold (seconds)
  # After this many seconds of silence, automatically stop recording and transcribe
  # Uses Voice Activity Detection (VAD) to monitor audio energy levels
  # Recommended: 1.5-3.0 seconds (lower = more responsive, higher = less false stops)
  silence_threshold: 2.0

  # Minimum audio length to transcribe (seconds)
  # Prevents transcription of very short audio clips (e.g., background noise)
  # Recommended: 0.3-1.0 seconds
  minimum_audio_length: 0.5

# System Tray Icon
system_tray:
  # Enable system tray icon
  enabled: true

  # Show notifications
  show_notifications: true

  # Notification duration (seconds)
  notification_duration: 2

# Wake Word Detection & Voice Commands
wake_word:
  # Enable wake word detection for voice commands
  # When enabled, say "AGENT" followed by a command
  enabled: true

  # Always listen for wake word (no hotkey needed)
  # When true, microphone is always on, listening for wake word
  # When false, you must hold push-to-talk hotkey first
  always_listening: true
