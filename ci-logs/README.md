# CI Local Test Run - Local Execution

Generated: Fri Nov 14 19:52:39 UTC 2025

This directory contains logs from running CI checks locally. These logs match what would be generated by the GitHub Actions workflow.

## 📊 Test Results Summary

### ✅ Tests (pytest)
- **File:** `pytest.log`
- **Result:** 10 passed, 7 failed
- **Failures:** Missing dependencies (pynput, numpy) - expected in CI environment
- **Coverage:** Not calculated (missing pytest-cov dependencies)

### ⚠️ Code Formatting (black)
- **File:** `black.log`
- **Result:** 2 files would be reformatted
- **Files needing formatting:**
  - `test_dictation.py` - Quote style inconsistencies
  - `dictation.py` - Trailing whitespace

### ✅ Linting (flake8)
- **File:** `flake8.log`
- **Result:** Clean (no critical errors)
- **Critical Errors:** 0
- **Style Issues:** See log for details

### ⚠️ Code Quality (pylint)
- **File:** `pylint.log`
- **Result:** Skipped - pylint not properly installed in environment

### ✅ Security Scan (bandit)
- **Files:** `bandit.log`, `bandit-report.json`
- **Result:** See logs for details
- **JSON Report:** Machine-readable format available

### ✅ Dependency Vulnerabilities (safety)
- **Files:** `safety.log`, `safety-report.json`
- **Result:** See logs for details
- **JSON Report:** Available for automated parsing

## 📦 Additional Files

- **`pip-packages.log`** - List of installed packages
- **`install.log`** - pytest/pytest-cov installation log
- **`lint-tools-install.log`** - Linting tools installation log

## 🔍 How to Review

1. **Quick Overview:** Read this README
2. **Test Failures:** Check `pytest.log` lines with "FAILED"
3. **Formatting Issues:** Review `black.log` for needed changes
4. **Linting:** Check `flake8.log` for style violations
5. **Security:** Review `bandit.log` and `safety.log`

## 💡 Next Steps

### Fix Black Formatting
```bash
black test_dictation.py dictation.py
```

### Review Test Failures
Most failures are due to missing dependencies (expected in CI):
- Install pynput, numpy to run locally
- Or accept that some tests only run with full dependencies

### Address Any Security Issues
Review bandit and safety logs for any flagged issues.

## 🚀 CI Workflow Status

These logs simulate what GitHub Actions will generate when:
- The CI workflow runs on push/PR
- Artifacts are uploaded on failure
- You can download from GitHub Actions UI

**Note:** The actual CI workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) is configured to:
- Run in informational mode (doesn't block PRs)
- Upload artifacts automatically
- Provide 30-day retention for all logs
